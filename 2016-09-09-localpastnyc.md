## What is the Local Preservation School?

Note:

About the [Local Preservation School](http://localpreservation.github.io/about/):

>The Local Preservation School is an open learning environment where preservation advocates and volunteers share with people how to save and sustain historic places in their communities. Our goal is to teach you how to get involved with historic preservation in your community through free online courses, easy-to-use tutorials and fun projects.
>This project is led by Baltimore Heritage with support from the National Park Service and National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers.

## What should the Local Preservation School teach?

Note:

The Local Preservation School is a **work-in-progress**. We believe a resource should be built _with_ the community of educators and learners we hope to serve not _for_ that community.

Keep in mind:

- Your experience in New York City may or may not apply in other situations.

What you going to get out of participating?

## How should the Local Preservation School teach?

Note:

Open and online education:


We are going to spend the late morning talking focusing on how we create lessons and then doing it ourselves.

Lesson design:

- Project based
- Authentic tasks
- Learner-centered

--

## Build with, not for.

Note:

Laurenellen McCann started writing about the concept of  **“build with, not for”** in civic technology in the summer of 2014.

Your participation today is a gift to our project and, I hope, a gift to our broader community of local preservationists.

## Questions?

---

## Open Education

--

### What are open educational resources?

Note:

Different people may have different definitions of open educational resources (often abbreviated as OER). Today, we are talking about OERs that are:

- available at **no cost** to educators and learners
- can be **modified** by educators and/or learners
- can be **redistributed** by educators who have made changes to the original work

[An Introduction to Open Education Resources](http://b7jl.org/oer/) (CC BY-SA):

>OER is not just textbook material. It can include anything from entire course shells, to syllabi, to assignments, to presentations. ...
> OER is important because it provides affordable material to students, allows faculty to enhance their own work, and provides faculty with content for classes.

Resources are typically distributed online but may be used in different ways. Some resources are adapted by educators to use in their own traditional classroom. Some resources become self-guided tutorials for independent learners.

Note:

About [WikiProject National Register of Historic Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_National_Register_of_Historic_Places)

>The project covers all articles about U.S. National Register of Historic Places listings in the English language Wikipedia. We try to improve Wikipedia's coverage of these listings by creating new articles or by improving existing ones.

The project is ten years old this fall and has created extensive [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_National_Register_of_Historic_Places/Resources "Wikipedia:WikiProject National Register of Historic Places/Resources") for anyone interested in developing articles about National Register designated resources.

Note:

About [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/frequently-asked-questions/):

>School of Data works to empower civil society organizations, journalists and citizens with the skills they need to use data effectively in their efforts to create more equitable and effective societies. ... There is huge potential to use data and open data to improve the lives of citizens around the world, especially in increasing the transparency and accountability of government. However, many of the groups who are closest to the problems – NGOs, journalists, and citizens – currently lack the skills to use data effectively — and even an awareness of the potential of data for their work. School of Data’s mission is to teach people how to gain powerful insights and create compelling stories using data.

## How do you teach and learn?

Note:

Let's take a minute to explore what resources we use to teach _and_ to learn.

1. Raise your hand if you referred to a textbook or a printed encyclopedia as a reference in the past _month_. Printed publications can be **limiting**.
2. Raise your hand if you referred to an article on Wikipedia as a reference in the past _month_. Free digital resources are **used**.
3. Raise your hand if you've _ever_ reused photographs from Flickr (or an archival digital collection like the Library of Congress) for a presentation. Free digital resources are **useful**.
4. Raise your hand if you've _ever_ adapted a colleague's presentation or notes to deliver yourself. **Remixing** is essential to creativity. It is an essential part of teaching and learning.
4. _Discuss_:
  - What other resources do you use to teach?
  - What other resources do you use to learn?

# Local Preservation School

Note:

We are trying to build a **learning community** _not_ just a textbook:

>Online courses often feel large, intimidating and anonymous. It’s hard to feel invested in multiple choice quizzes, textbook chapters and hum-drum Q & A forums where you don’t know anyone.
>In a stellar learning experience, you’d know who was in the room and feel super-comfy. You’d make projects together and find help when you get stuck. You’d want to send people thank-you cards and chicken soup.

_Discuss_:

1. Can you think of someone who taught you an important skill or idea?
2. Can you think of someone that you have taught an important skill or idea?
3. Share some ideas about who you teach and who you learn from.

## How are we approaching teaching?

--

### Offer people authentic tasks

Note:

> Asks the student to "do" the subject" ... [and] Replicates key challenging situations in which adults are truly "test" in the workplace, in civic life, and in personal life. Real challenges involve specific situations with "messiness" and meaningful goals: important constraints, "noise," purposes, and audiences at work. In contrast, almost all school tests are without context (even when a writing prompt tries to suggest a sense of purpose and audience).

--

### Design learning around problems

Note:

So if you are interested in teaching people how to tell a story about a historic place in their community, how do you present them with authentic tasks—real challenges. McDaniel suggests three key components:

1. Design around Problems and Frame Using GRASPS (goal, role, audience, situation, product, standards).
2. Find a Real Audience, online or in person.
3. Peer review and response

## Designing content for online education

Note:

- Playful projects
- Design for all senses
- Low floors, wide walls
- Focus on themes
- Inspire with diverse examples

---

# Building a lesson together

## Creating Open Educational Resources

Note:

When we create OERs what are we trying to create?

- **Findable**. That means including metadata about the work and the class so users will know what to expect.
- **Usable**. Material should be as open as possible.
- **Licensed**. Make sure you indicate what can be done with the work and any restrictions you have, although the less restrictive the license, the better.
