# Welcome

Note:

Welcome. Let's start with some housekeeping:

- Where is the coffee?
- Where are the restrooms?
- How do you get on the wifi?

**Activity:** Three Word Introductions

1. _Say_: If you had to describe yourself in three words, which three would you choose? Take a minute to choose your three words.
2. _Do_: Model an introduction by introducing yourself. Continue around the room taking turns until each participant introduces themselves.

# What are we doing today?

Note:

Our goal for the day to is make this a two-way educational environment. We all are experts at something and we all can try to learn something new.

1. For the first hour or so, we will talk about:
  - How open educational resources work
  - The importance of education to preservation and community heritage
2. The next hour or so, we will discuss:
  - Your priorities for what you want people to learn (and what you want to teach)
  - How you can create open educational resources
3. Finally, we'll end the morning by:
  - Creating lessons based on Preservation Alliance resources (or your own ideas)
  - Offering feedback to each other on the lessons we've made'

  ## What do **we** get out of today's study group?

  Note:

  We think you are experts. But you're also really busy. You know things and you do things but you might not always have enough time to write them down.

--

## What do **you** get out of today's study group?

Note:

We think the internet is important to the future of preservation. Online education is important. Education and empowerment are difficult jobs. We want to make your job easier. We want to inspire you to try new things. We want you to get to know one another.

## Build with, not for.

![](/presentations/images/noun_476748.png)

Note:

<!-- TODO: Add image credit and alt text. -->

Laurenellen McCann started writing about the concept of  **"build with, not for"** in civic technology in the summer of 2014. The idea is that we need  to be "prioritizing community leadership in the creation of tech above the tools themselves."

To make a useful resource, we think want to build a school _with_ the community of educators and learners who care about historic preservation. Not just _for_ that community.

Your participation today is a gift to our project and, I hope, a gift to our broader community of local preservationists.

## What is the Local Preservation School?

--

Note:

This workshop is the first in a series we are organizing for our [Local Preservation School](http://localpreservation.github.io/about/) project:

>The Local Preservation School is an open learning environment where preservation advocates and volunteers share with people how to save and sustain historic places in their communities. Our goal is to teach you how to get involved with historic preservation in your community through free online courses, easy-to-use tutorials and fun projects.
>This project is led by Baltimore Heritage with support from the National Park Service and National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers.

We hope to teach you a bit about emerging approaches to open education but we also want to recruit you as collaborators (at least for the day) to talk about two big questions:

- What does the Local Preservation School teach?
- How does the Local Preservation School teach?

--

## What does the Local Preservation School teach?

--

![Classroom of the Marine School at Log Cabin Village, a house museum consisting of saved rural cabins moved to a central site in Fort Worth, Texas](https://localpreservation.github.io/images/30602v.jpg)

Note:

What does the school teach? Honestly, we are still figuring that out. The Local Preservation School is a **work-in-progress** and we invited you here today because we want you to be part of it.

But we think the work of the Preservation Alliance is a solid foundation to build on.

## How should the Local Preservation School teach?

--

![Courtesy Library of Congress.](https://localpreservation.github.io/images/14293u.jpg)

Note:

<!-- TODO: Fill in missing image credit. -->

But there are a few things that make this project different than most of the preservation publications, webinars, or workshops that already exist. We are focused on connecting people to free **open educational resources** in an online environment.

We are using an open Creative Commons license and publishing on a platform – GitHub – that is used for thousands of collaborative, community-driven, open source projects in the technology sector.

Building the Local Preservation School online also means we meet people where they are: organizing Baltimore's cemetery clean-ups on Facebook; brainstorming ideas for adaptive reuse in New York City by email newsletter; and sharing photos of "preservation-ready sites" online and on social media in Buffalo.

Building lessons for the web also enable us to avoid reinventing the wheel and reuse the wide variety of resources that already exist.

Most of all, we want to make sure that we are creating a resource that is connected to the real world challenges faced by small nonprofits, community groups, and volunteer advocates trying to preserve historic places in their communities.

We are not looking to teach local history or architectural styles for their own sake. We want to teach people what you can do with that knowledge: proactive, community-based historic preservation advocacy.

## How do you **teach** and **learn**?

Note:

<!-- FIXME: Let's rework this as a think-pair-share exercise. -->

Let's take a few minutes to explore what resources we already use to _teach_ and to _learn_.

1. Raise your hand if you referred to a textbook or a printed encyclopedia as a reference in the past _month_. Printed publications can be **limiting**.
2. Raise your hand if you referred to an article on Wikipedia as a reference in the past _month_. Free digital resources are **used**.
3. Raise your hand if you've _ever_ reused photographs from Flickr (or an archival digital collection like the Library of Congress) for a presentation. Free digital resources are **useful**.
4. Raise your hand if you've _ever_ adapted a colleague's presentation or notes to deliver yourself. **Remixing** is essential to creativity. It is an essential part of teaching and learning.
5. _Discuss_:
  - What resources do you use to **teach**?
  - What resources do you use to **learn**?
  - What makes a resource **useful** for you?

## Open Education

--

### What are open educational resources?

Note:

Different people may have different definitions of open educational resources (often abbreviated as OER). Today, we are talking about OERs that are:

- available at **no cost** to educators and learners
- can be **modified** by educators and/or learners
- can be **redistributed** by educators who have made changes to the original work

[An Introduction to Open Education Resources](http://b7jl.org/oer/) (CC BY-SA):

>OER is not just textbook material. It can include anything from entire course shells, to syllabi, to assignments, to presentations. ...
> OER is important because it provides affordable material to students, allows faculty to enhance their own work, and provides faculty with content for classes.

Resources are typically distributed online but may be used in different ways. Some resources are adapted by educators to use in their own traditional classroom. Some resources become self-guided tutorials for independent learners.

<!-- TODO: Insert chart on the rising cost of textbooks. Connect issues of accessible education and information to equity of participation. -->

Note:

About [WikiProject National Register of Historic Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_National_Register_of_Historic_Places)

>The project covers all articles about U.S. National Register of Historic Places listings in the English language Wikipedia. We try to improve Wikipedia's coverage of these listings by creating new articles or by improving existing ones.

The project is ten years old this fall and has created extensive [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_National_Register_of_Historic_Places/Resources "Wikipedia:WikiProject National Register of Historic Places/Resources") for anyone interested in developing articles about National Register designated landmarks or historic districts.

Note:

About [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/frequently-asked-questions/):

>School of Data works to empower civil society organizations, journalists and citizens with the skills they need to use data effectively in their efforts to create more equitable and effective societies. ... There is huge potential to use data and open data to improve the lives of citizens around the world, especially in increasing the transparency and accountability of government. However, many of the groups who are closest to the problems – NGOs, journalists, and citizens – currently lack the skills to use data effectively — and even an awareness of the potential of data for their work. School of Data’s mission is to teach people how to gain powerful insights and create compelling stories using data.

## Building community online

Note:

We are trying to build a **learning community** _not_ just a textbook:

>Online courses often feel large, intimidating and anonymous. It’s hard to feel invested in multiple choice quizzes, textbook chapters and hum-drum Q & A forums where you don’t know anyone.
>In a stellar learning experience, you’d know who was in the room and feel super-comfy. You’d make projects together and find help when you get stuck. You’d want to send people thank-you cards and chicken soup.

## Who are the "students"?

1. Volunteers
2. Preservation professionals
3. Related professionals

Note:

Who are we building resources for? There is _no such thing_ as the _general public_. But there are three groups of people we hope to reach:

- Volunteers advocating for preservation in their community.
- Preservation professionals at volunteer-supported organizations.
- Professionals in related fields who work with preservation advocates or partners.

We think people who _do_ historic preservation are a diverse group. What it means to _do_ historic preservation means different things in different contexts. Who do you want to reach with your educational efforts?

_Discuss_:

1. Can you think of someone who taught you an important skill or idea?
2. Can you think of someone that you have taught an important skill or idea?
3. Share some reflections on who you teach and who you learn from.

<!-- TODO: Insert a photograph of people here! There are no photos of people in this presentation. -->

--

## What are the "lessons"?

Note:

  - New things v. Adapting existing things
  - Text v. interactive things
  - Big things v. little things
- How do we expect these resources to be used?
  - Self-guided v. Facilitated settings
  - Adapted for new uses?

<!-- TODO: Insert screenshot for Explore Baltimore Heritage if possible. -->

What makes this so exciting for us is the potential to engage Baltimore residents in a deeper partnership around the work we are already doing. Instead of organizing our own tours, we can promote tours organized by neighborhood historians. Instead of researching the history of local landmarks, we'd like to empower residents to do research for themselves. We'd be happy to work ourselves out of a job.

Note:

And this is a model that is relevant to more than just Baltimore. We've collected and mapped out over 200 local history research guides. Teaching research, writing, and interpretation is something that preservation groups, local libraries, historical societies, and small museums across the country are wroking to do.

Couldn't we build something pretty cool if we started working together?

### Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia

---

## What does the Preservation Alliance try to teach?

Note:

We are looking at a set of learning objectives based on on How to Look at Your Neighborhood: A Guide for Community Organizations (2011) by the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia. The goal of this resource is to assist residents and neighborhood organizations:

- with identifying the distinctive physical characteristics of their neighborhood worthy of preservation
- in identifying the distinctive physical characteristics and strengths of their neighborhood and define projects for grant applications
- in identifying the distinctive physical characteristics of their neighborhood and historic resources that might be appropriate to include in neighborhood/district plans

Distribute the handout for the [Neighborhood Guide Learning Objectives Discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF0yHcjyseJ0CTNAm5PcfQd-o7dhuzOqfKNguN3q3GY/edit?usp=sharing)

---

## What skills and concepts do _you_ want to teach?

Note:

_Activity_: Help shape the lesson objectives for the Local Preservation School

1. Start by reviewing the "lessons" outlined on the hand out.
2. Give participants a few minutes of quiet to put a few thoughts onto paper.
3. Ask people to share the ideas and skills they listed.
4. Ask people to share the project ideas they listed.
5. Once we define our topics, we need to set some priorities. Here are some possible approaches to soliciting priorities from workshop participants:  
  - [Card sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)
  - dot voting/idea rating ([info](http://www.idearatingsheets.org/vs-dot-voting))
6. Optionally we can also look at the relationships between the topics using a hexagons-based activity:
  - Hexagons (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEceTh7txew), [generator](http://www.classtools.net/hexagon/), [template](https://tracyannclark.com/2014/09/23/10-reasons-to-try-hexagonal-thinking/))

<!-- TODO: Think more about the possibility of using hexagons or card sorting for the Philadelphia workshop. -->

### Let's take a break

---

## How do we teach these skills and concepts?

Note:

We are going to spend 20 minutes on pedagogical design and online education, including:

- How to create with a learning community
- How to create or curate engaging content
- How to offer students authentic tasks
- How to design learning around problems

## Create with a community

Note:

The way we see it, any online learning experience consists of three parts:

- Social presence (that you have a crew & we’re in it together)
- Cognitive presence (ideas & content)
- Teaching presence (feedback & questions)

Design with a community.

Peers provide an audience and an important source of feedback.

Source: [P2PU](http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/community/concepts/)

--

## Create (or curate) engaging content

- Playful projects
- Design for all senses
- Low floors, wide walls
- Focus on themes
- Inspire with diverse examples

Note:

We recall information best when we:

- design for all senses
- build a real-life project that is applicable to our lives
- present that project to others for feedback
- share our ideas with the wider world

>How could someone make a project where they fiddle, tinker and lose themselves in it? Open-ended projects and thematic prompts help learners find their own paths and ideas.

>We recall information best when it engages several of our senses.

>We recommend activities that can work for both beginner and advanced learners. Activities of this type have few barriers to entry ( and make use of easy-to-use tools like Googledocs or Twitter) but are flexible enough to allow advanced folks to add layers of more complex elements.

>Instead of encouraging learners to compete to solve a problem, select a thematic focus for a project. Instead of working deductively towards a "correct" solution, learners are free to follow their personal passions.

>Showcasing a range of work inspires learners to imagine what’s possible (as opposed to what’s correct). At the same time, an array of different projects models inclusivity, builds a broad community of learners.

--

## Offer people authentic tasks

Note:

> Asks the student to "do" the subject" ... [and] Replicates key challenging situations in which adults are truly "test" in the workplace, in civic life, and in personal life. Real challenges involve specific situations with "messiness" and meaningful goals: important constraints, "noise," purposes, and audiences at work. In contrast, almost all school tests are without context (even when a writing prompt tries to suggest a sense of purpose and audience).

Source: [W. Caleb McDaniel](http://draft.sx/99556e1384e8d6a589ad)

--

## Design learning around problems

Note:

So if you are interested in teaching people how to tell a story about a historic place in their community, how do you present them with authentic tasks—real challenges. McDaniel suggests three key components:

1. Design around Problems and Frame Using  (goal, role, audience, situation, product, standards).
2. Find a Real Audience, online or in person.
3. Peer review and response

## Let's create lessons together

Note:

We are talking about "lessons" in this workshop but they are sometimes called modules or learning activities. Lessons is a familiar term so we are sticking with it.

--

Start with our **lesson template**: [bit.ly/localpast-template](http://bit.ly/localpast-template)

<!-- TODO: We need to revise the lesson template and archive the prior version. I'd like to create a Markdown version for GitHub along with the Google Docs version. -->

Or start from scratch!

Note:

We are recommending Google Docs for this activity. You can also create a lesson on paper or with other digital tools instead.

_Activity_: Creating a lesson
 - Distribute lesson templates. Review what goes into a lesson.
 - Create an outline for your lesson.
 - Do you need any additional resources? Identify what images, video, audio, documents may be helpful to add.
 - Where can participants dig deeper into this topic? Identify related links/resources, examples for closer study, etc.

---

## Let's eat some lunch

---

## Let's discuss the lessons we created

**Remember:** feedback is best given with I-statements.

Try saying: I like... I wish... What if...

Note:

Liz Lerman – Critical Response Process

>Feedback is best given with I-statements. For example, "I sometimes feel you don’t listen to me" instead of "You don’t listen to a word I say." Specifically, "I like, I wish, What if" (IL/IW/WI) is a simple tool to encourage open feedback.

Source: ["I Like, I Wish, What If" Method of Feedback](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/i-like-i-wish-what-if.pdf)

_Activity_: Peer feedback and critique (60 min – Molly/Eli)
 - Each pair/group presents a lesson
 - Participants respond with feedback/comments/suggestions

---

## How do you share open educational resources?

Note:

OERs need to be:

- **Findable**. That means including metadata about the work and the class so users will know what to expect.
- **Usable**. Material should be as open as possible.
- **Licensed**. Make sure you indicate what can be done with the work and any restrictions you have, although the less restrictive the license, the better.

We are using GitHub and Jekyll. You can use Google Docs.
