# Overview

In mid-October, I saw an announcement about the NEH-funded Openlab unconference/workshop on Twitter and thought it might be a good opportunity to share an introduction to the Local Preservation School with a broader audience of GLAM professionals with interest and expertise on open source projects and technical innovation in the cultural heritage sector. The Openlab organizers accepted my proposal on November 12 and I just spent the last few days preparing my slides and notes. What is Openlab? According to the [Openlab Concept description](http://openlabworkshop.wikispaces.com/Openlab+Concept):

>Openlab is envisioned as a solutions lab, convener, and consultancy designed to accelerate the speed and impact of transformational change in the GLAM (gallery, library, archive, and museum) sector.

The presentations (including this one) are all in the style of an Ignite talk: 20 slides with automatic transitions timed to 15 seconds per slide for a total presentation time fo 5 mintues.

## Presentation Description

The Local Preservation School is a new online school to share the skills and knowledge you need to get your neighbors excited about local history, protect threatened landmarks from demolition, or secure resources for reinvestment in your historic neighborhood. Taking inspiration from new approaches to online learning for data-wrangling, digital history, and computer programming, we wondered how can we use the web (and open-source tools) to make it easier for people across the country to learn about historic preservation? How can we do a better job sharing the skills and knowledge needed to save historic places? This talk is a quick introduction to the project, an invitation to potential contributors and a discussion of how open education can support the effort to integrate technology into small, volunteer-led history and preservation efforts.

## Background

- 15 seconds of spoken text is about 30-40 words (assuming around 130 words per minute)

# Notes

1. Local Preservation School

Hello! My name is Eli Pousson and I work for a small nonprofit in Baltimore, Maryland dedicated to historic preservation advocacy and heritage education. I’m here to introduce the Local Preservation School, explain why I think open source matters to historic preservation, and invite you to get involved as a student, a teacher (or maybe both).

2. What is historic preservation?

Let’s start by asking: what is historic preservation? Preservation is inspired by the idea that important stories are not found only in museums and libraries. Important stories are everywhere around us—in parks and public art, buildings and neighborhoods. 

3. Saving places that matter to people.

Good stories about historic places are really about people. Historic preservation means saving places that matter to people. Historian Eric Sandweiss explained it neatly when he wrote:

>“\[the history of a city street] means little if it’s not tied to the story of the farmer who sold the land, the developer who bought it from him, the families who campaigned to have it paved, the men who laid the asphalt, or the children who rode their bikes on it.”

4. Changes in preservation from 1960 to 2015.

Over 50 years have past since a group of civic-minded architects, activists and historians established Baltimore Heritage. In 1960, we fought against highways and urban renewal with mimeographed newsletters and sharply worded letters-to-the-editor. In 2015, we fight for revitalization with creative public programs, smartphone apps and social media.

5. How do you save historic places?

In most American cities, saving historic places starts with education. Preservation planners at understaffed public agencies teach coworkers, volunteer docents at a local historic site teach neighbors, and nonprofit advocates teach everyone we can. We teach people why old buildings matter and why it makes sense to fix them up.

6. Laugh to keep from crying. Do what you can.

When you feel like the weight of 16,000 vacant historic rowhouses is resting on your shoulders, it can be tough to feel like you are making a difference. I often ask people: what do you get when you cross a program director, a volunteer manager, and a janitor? A typical situation in most nonprofit organizations.

7. You use free and open tools.

One of the most important lessons we have learned at Baltimore Heritage is that free digital tools are key to overcoming the limit of a small staff or budget. Open source projects like WordPress or Omeka empower us to connect with our neighbors. If we relied solely on costly, properietary tools, we could spend twice the money with half the difference.

8. Good news. You're not alone.

Good news. You can find local preservationists working hard in communities around the country—maybe you are one of them. Bad news. Many preservationists are still struggling to learn the new tools and approaches they need to achieve their own goals.
