# Overview

In mid-October, I saw an announcement about the NEH-funded Openlab unconference/workshop on Twitter and thought it might be a good opportunity to share an introduction to the Local Preservation School with a broader audience of GLAM professionals with interest and expertise on open source projects and technical innovation in the cultural heritage sector. The Openlab organizers accepted my proposal on November 12 and I just spent the last few days preparing my slides and notes. What is Openlab? According to the [Openlab Concept description](http://openlabworkshop.wikispaces.com/Openlab+Concept):

>Openlab is envisioned as a solutions lab, convener, and consultancy designed to accelerate the speed and impact of transformational change in the GLAM (gallery, library, archive, and museum) sector.

The presentations (including this one) are all in the style of an Ignite talk: 20 slides with automatic transitions timed to 15 seconds per slide for a total presentation time fo 5 mintues.

## Presentation Description

The Local Preservation School is a new online school to share the skills and knowledge you need to get your neighbors excited about local history, protect threatened landmarks from demolition, or secure resources for reinvestment in your historic neighborhood. Taking inspiration from new approaches to online learning for data-wrangling, digital history, and computer programming, we wondered how can we use the web (and open-source tools) to make it easier for people across the country to learn about historic preservation? How can we do a better job sharing the skills and knowledge needed to save historic places? This talk is a quick introduction to the project, an invitation to potential contributors and a discussion of how open education can support the effort to integrate technology into small, volunteer-led history and preservation efforts.
